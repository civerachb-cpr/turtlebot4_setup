TODO: Use correct github links

# Pre-built Image
Every Turtlebot4 comes with a SD card with a pre-installed Turtlebot4 image. If you wish to install an image on your own SD card or update to a newer image, follow these instructions. Otherwise you can skip to [Wi-Fi Setup](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/turtlebot4_robot/edit/galactic/README.md#wifi-setup).

- Download the [latest turtlebot4 image](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4-images).

- Plug in your SD card to your PC and identify it:
```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```
- The SD card will have a name like `/dev/mmcblk0` or `/dev/sda`

- Get the SD flash script and flash the SD card
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clearpathrobotics/turtlebot4_robot/galactic/turtlebot4_setup/scripts/sd_flash.sh?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQHRAFET3BBZQX74MAK6JKEYQC4G3Q
bash sd_flash.sh /path/to/image
```
- Follow the instructions and wait for the SD card to be flashed.

- Ensure your Raspberry Pi 4 is not powered before inserting the flashed SD card. 

## WiFi Setup

- Boot the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi will enter AP mode which will allow you to connect to it over WiFi.

- On a PC, connect to the `Turtlebot4` WiFi network. The password is also `Turtlebot4`.

- Once connected, you can SSH into the Raspberry Pi to configure its WiFi.

```bash
ssh ubuntu@10.42.0.1
```
- The default password is `turtlebot4`

- In the home folder there will be a script called `wifi.sh` which can be used to configure the Raspberry Pi's WiFi:
```bash
bash ~/wifi.sh -s "YOUR_WIFI_SSID" -p "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD" -c YOUR_REGULATORY_DOMAIN && sudo reboot
```
Note: The Regulatory domain is based on the country you live in. For a full list, click [here](https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/InstantWenger_Mobile/Advanced/Content/Instant%20User%20Guide%20-%20volumes/Country_Codes_List.htm#regulatory_domain_3737302751_1017918).

- Your Raspberry Pi will reboot and connect to your WiFi network.
- On your PC, run `ros2 topic list` to ensure that the Turtlebot4 is publishing its topics.
- Run `ros2 topic echo /ip` to read the new IP of the Raspberry Pi. On the Turtlebot4 Standard this will also be displayed on the screen.
- You can now SSH into the Turtlebot4 at the new IP and begin using it.
```bash
ssh ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

# Manual Setup

## Create an Ubuntu Image

If you wish to manually create the Turtlebot4 image, first install the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

- Plug your SD card into your PC and run the Raspberry Pi Imager. Follow the instructions and install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS onto the SD card.
- Ensure your Raspberry Pi 4 is not powered before inserting the flashed SD card. 
- You can set up the Pi by either connecting it to your network via Ethernet or by using a keyboard and HDMI monitor via a micro HDMI cable.

### Ethernet Setup
- Connect the Raspberry Pi to your Network with an Ethernet cable.
- Boot the Raspberry Pi. 
- Find the Raspberry Pi's IP using your router's portal or by calling `arp -a` on your PC.
- SSH into the Raspberry Pi using the IP address.
```bash
ssh ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```
- The default login is `ubuntu` and password is `ubuntu`. You will be prompted to change your password.
### HDMI Setup
- Connect a keyboard to the Raspberry Pi via USB.
- Connect a monitor to the Raspberry Pi via the HDMI0 port.
- Boot the Raspberry Pi
- The default login is `ubuntu` and password is `ubuntu`. You will be prompted to change your password.

## Manually configure Wi-Fi
Once you are logged into the Raspberry Pi, configure the Wi-Fi:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```
Add the following lines:
```bash
wifis:
    wlan0:
        optional: true
        access-points:
            "YOUR_WIFI_SSID":
                password: "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
        dhcp4: true
```
Note: Ensure that `wifis:` is aligned with the existing `ethernets:` line. All indentations should be 4 spaces. Do not use tabs.
- Reboot the Raspberry Pi. It should now be connected to your Wi-Fi.
- Find the Raspberry Pi's IP using your router's portal or by calling `arp -a` on your PC.
- SSH into the Raspberry Pi using the IP address.
```bash
ssh ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

## Create your workspace

- Once logged in, create a workspace.
```bash
mkdir ~/turtlebot4_ws/src -p
```
- Clone this repository into the src folder
```bash
cd ~/turtlebot4_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/turtlebot4_robot
```

## Automatic Setup
- Run the `turtlebot4_setup.sh` script to automatically set up your turtlebot4.

#### Turtlebot4 Standard
```bash
cd ~/turtlebot4_ws
bash src/turtlebot4_robot/turtlebot4_setup/scripts/turtlebot4_setup.sh -m standard
```

#### Turtlebot4 Lite
```bash
cd ~/turtlebot4_ws
bash src/turtlebot4_robot/turtlebot4_setup/scripts/turtlebot4_setup.sh -m lite
```

- Run [Wi-Fi Setup](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/turtlebot4_robot/edit/galactic/README.md#wifi-setup) to enable the 5G Wi-Fi band.
